## Why not open source?

## About tun mode

- Right-click on Win and run as administrator
- Enter the command sudo /Applications/pandora-box-amd64.app/Contents/MacOS/Pandora-Box in the Mac terminal
### Why is it not recommended to enable it?
- To support tunnel mode, the software requires advanced permissions
- Tunnel mode sometimes causes CPU usage to explode
- Disable tunnel, the software memory usage is relatively stable
